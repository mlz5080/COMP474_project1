It explores paradigms and case studies in the history of visual anthropology by highlighting the stylistic, social scientific, commercial, and political agendas that influence the production of visual documents. Starting with colonial exhibitions of “exotic natives,” the course progresses to classic and contemporary ethnographic film with a focus on Curtis, Flaherty, Mead, Gardner, Rouch, and MacDougall.""" ;

In Phase I, Biology students learn basic computer hardware and software concepts, while Engineering students are introduced to gene structure and recombinant DNA technology. In Phase II, all students learn the principles and various applications of cell-based computational machines. Students work in teams to create a project proposal to describe the design of a computational machine using gene regulatory networks. A project is required.

The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the Jazz Age, the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance.

Being able to disseminate your research to a wider public does not only help society but also increase your recognition as an expert.    This workshop will give participants a broad sense of how media outlets function and what opportunities exist to share research findings with a broader public.

It stimulates questioning techniques, dialogue, choices and involves a variety of strategies designed to promote greater overall student engagement. But what happens to student engagement when it comes to assessment? A central component and a real challenge faculty face when implementing active learning is how to make learner assessments equally active so that students experience continuity. In this workshop we will look at practical strategies that can help faculty develop assessments that promote deeper learning with a particular emphasis on collaborative exams (two-stage exams). A portion of the workshop will be spent working collaboratively on the planning and design of assessments for active learning. Participants are encouraged to bring along an existing assessment to work on as part of the re-envisioning process.    This workshop will be facilitated by: " ;

By taking  a hands-on teaching approach, graduate students are taught a set of techniques of descriptive and predictive analytics, which emphasizes extensive analysis of real (or realistic) data sets from a variety of organizations such as manufacturing, service and healthcare using statistical packages. Students are also taught techniques for proper visualization and presentation of the results of their analysis. Specific analytics methods such as logistic regression, time series, decision trees, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, k-means are covered. A project is required." ;

Possible memory case studies include the 1641 Rebellion; the Williamite War; the 1798 Rising; the Great Famine; the First World War and the events of the Irish Revolution; the Northern Irish ?Troubles?; and Church-State institutional abuse in independent Ireland.

At a deeper level, it is also intended to explain what mathematics is all about and why some easily stated assertions, such as Fermats last theorem, are so difficult to prove. Students who complete the course successfully should have enough understanding and knowledge of fundamental ideas and techniques of mathematics to appreciate its power, its beauty, and its relevance in so many different fields such as architecture, art, commerce, engineering, music, and all of the sciences.

Students learn how to control the camera, expose film properly (transparency and negative), develop good printing skills in colour, and produce a coherent body of work. They should become aware of how colour contributes to the structure and meaning of photographs. Other topics include the history of colour photography and aesthetic and conceptual issues in the work of contemporary photographers.
